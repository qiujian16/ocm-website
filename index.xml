      <description>This page tells you the architecture and basic concepts in open-cluster-management.
   Overview Hub cluster Klusterlet Managed cluster Application lifecycle Governance and risk     Overview open-cluster-management enables any capability within the Kubernetes ecosystem to orchestrate itself across multiple clusters and cloud providers. Consider the requirements that a capability within the Kubernetes ecosystem would need to become multicluster-aware.
 The service must have an API to determine the inventory of available clusters.</description>

      <description>The are two ways to install the core control plane of open cluster management that includes cluster registration and manifests distribution.
   Prerequisite Install from source Install community operator from OperatorHub.io     Prerequisite Ensure kubectl and kustomize are installed.
Ensure golang is installed, if you are planning to install from the source.
Prepare one Kubernetes cluster to function as the hub. For example, use kind to create a hub cluster.</description>

      <description>Prerequisites Select dev environment clusters using placement Apply the Kubernetes resources to the selected clusters  After bootstrapped the Open Cluster Management environment, you can now deploy any Kubernetes resources(such as Deployment, Service, Configmap, Secret, and so on) to your desired clusters:
 Use placement to select the desired clusters if you do not know the certain desired clustersâ€™ name but could describe the expected characteristics of ideal clusters. Use ManifestWork to apply your Kubernetes resources to the selected clusters  Here is a sample to deploy a hello-world Deployment to the dev environment clusters:</description>

      <description>After the cluster manager is installed on the hub cluster, you need to install the klusterlet agent on another cluster so that it can be registered and managed by the hub cluster.
   Prerequisite Install from source Install community operator from OperatorHub.io What is next Troubleshooting     Prerequisite Ensure kubectl and kustomize are installed.
Ensure golang is installed, if you are planning to install from the source.</description>

      <description>ManagedCluster Registration ManagedCluster is a cluster scoped API on the hub cluster to define a Kubernetes cluster registered with the hub cluster. In open-cluster-management, the cluster registration follows a double opt-in mechanism which is:
 An agent opts in to register a cluster with the hub by creating a ManagedCluster resource on the hub. The agent needs a kubeconfig with appropriate permission (bootstrap kubeconfig) to initiate the registration request An admin user on the hub opts in to explicitly accept the registration of the ManagedCluster.</description>

      <description>What is ManifestWork ManifestWork is to define a group of Kubernetes resource on the hub to be applied to the managed cluster. In the open-cluster-management project, a ManifestWork resource must be created in the cluster namespace. A work agent implemented in work project is run on the managed cluster and monitors the ManifestWork resource in the cluster namespace on the hub cluster.
An example of ManifestWork to deploy a deployment to the managed cluster is shown in the following example.</description>

      <guid>http://open-cluster-management.io/concepts/placement/</guid>
      <description>Placement API is used to select a set of managed clusters in one or multiple ManagedClusterSets so that the user&amp;rsquo;s workloads can be deployed to these clusters.
Bind ManagedClusterSet to a namespace Before creating a Placement, you need to create a ManagedClusterSetBinding in a namespace to bind to a ManagedClusterSet. Then you can create a Placement in the same namespace to select the clusters in this ManagedClusterSet. Assume a ManagedClusterSet is created on the hub cluster as seen in the following examples.</description>

      <description>What is an add-on? Open-cluster-management has a mechanism to help developers to develop an extension based on the foundation components for the purpose of working with multiple clusters in various asepcts. Examples of add-ons includes:
 A tool to collect alert events in the managed cluster, and send to the hub cluster. A network solution that uses the hub to share the network info and establish connection among managed clusters. A tool to spread security policies to multiple clusters.</description>
